  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Extension:</strong> Microsoft to Pedosoft Replacer</p>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-02-05</p>
  <p class="muted">This policy explains what information the extension can access and how it is handled.</p>

  <h2>What the extension does</h2>
  <p>
    The extension is a satirical text replacer. It runs as a Chrome <strong>content script</strong> and replaces certain
    predefined words/phrases on webpages you visit by scanning text nodes in the page and updating the displayed text.
    It skips scripts, styles, and typical user input elements (such as <code>input</code>, <code>textarea</code>, and editable content).
  </p>

  <h2>Where it runs</h2>
  <p>
    The extension is configured to run on pages that match <code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code>. This means it may operate on any webpage
    you open in your browser in order to perform the text replacements.
  </p>

  <h2>Information the extension may access</h2>
  <p>
    To replace text, the extension may read and modify the text content displayed on the webpage (the page’s DOM text nodes).
    This processing occurs <strong>locally on your device</strong> inside your browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Data collection</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not</strong> collect personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>Data transmission</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not</strong> transmit data to the developer or to third parties.
    It does not include analytics, advertising, tracking, telemetry, or remote logging, and it does not make network requests
    for data collection.
  </p>

  <h2>Data storage</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does not store browsing history or webpage content.
    It also does not store user settings in its current version. If a future version adds optional settings storage
    (for example via <code>chrome.storage</code>), it will store only user preferences needed for functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>The extension does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this same URL with a new effective date.
  </p>
